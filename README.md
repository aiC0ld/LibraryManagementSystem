Future extensions:

In the. IO package, it might have been cleaner to use setters to capture the various fields for the constructor. Use of try/catch was done well, where used, but perhaps needed more. Parameter checking was limited.  In ServicesModel, some use of helper functions could shorten the code and make more readable. In searchBookItem in the ServicesModel, the code is redundant and could be simplified. Could have been done with a single for loop, and a helper function for checking the fields.
